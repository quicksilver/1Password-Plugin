## 1Password Plugin

The 1Password plugin for Quicksilver gives you the ability to manipulate 1Password data from Quicksilver, and to Go & Fill web logins.

### Requirements

For Quicksilver to index your logins, you will need to enable integration with 3rd party apps in the "Advanced" section of 1Password's preferences.

### Catalog

This plugin allows Quicksilver to index your 1Password Logins.

You can access all these items by right arrowing (→) into the 1Password.app in Quicksilver's first pane.

You may also add these items to your catalog by going to the [Catalog preferences](qs://preferences#QSCatalogPrefPane) and enabling the '1Password' entry.

### Actions

Go & Fill
: The Go & Fill action is available for 1Password web forms. When run on a web form, the plugin takes you to your browser and logs you in using the login.

Go & Fill With…
: This action is an extension of the 'Go & Fill' action, and allows you to specify a browser to use when filling the login/web form.

Reveal in 1Password
: The Reveal in 1Password action launches 1Password and selects the entry in the application, allowing you to manipulate or view its details.
